<H1>Common boot (HIR): Implementation-independent High-level Intermediate Representation as control-flow graph</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

  This library defines classes of instructions of a High-level
  Intermediate Representation (HIR) that can be used to represent any
  Common Lisp program as a control-flow graph.  The representation
  does not depend on any particular implementation detail of any
  particular Common Lisp implementation (such as the function-call
  protocol, or the representation of objects).  Objects manipulated
  are Common Lisp objects.

</p>


<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>

  This library has no dependencies.
