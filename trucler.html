<H1>Trucler: Compile-time lexical environments</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

  This library provides functionality for compile-time lexical
  environments.  It can be seen as an improvement (complete,
  extensible) over the environment functions in section 8.5 of "Common
  Lisp the Language, Second Edition".  It presents a uniform protocol
  for querying and augmenting environment, but it supports several
  possible underlying representations of environment, so that it can
  be used by existing Common Lisp implementations.  Only two
  implementions are currently supported, namely the <i>native</i>
  implementation that can be useed in a new Common Lisp
  implementation, and an implementation compatible with SBCL.


</p>

<p>

  This library contains documentation strings for most of its
  functions and classes, and it comes with a test suite.

</p>

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>

  Depends on <a href="acclimation.html">Acclimation</a>.  Uses
  standard classes and generic functions, so CLOS is rquired.

</p>

<H2>Maintainers</H2>

<p>

  Currently maintained by Tarn W. Burton.

</p>

<H2>Possible improvements</H2>

<p>

  Add support for other existing Common Lisp implementations
