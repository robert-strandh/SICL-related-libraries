<H1>Inravina: An implementation of the Common Lisp pretty printer</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

  This library provides a complete implementation of the
  Common Lisp pretty printer.

</p>

<p>

  Inravina is configurable.  Client code can alter many aspects of the
  library by supplying a <i>client</i> object, which is an instance of
  a standard class.

</p>


<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>


  Depends on <a href="incless.html">Incless</a> and 
  <a href="https://github.com/yitzchak/nontrivial-gray-streams"> non-trivial-gray-streams</a>.


</p>

<p>


  Uses standard classes for client configuration, for the
  representation of pretty-print instructions, and for dispatch
  tables. Therefore, CLOS is required for this library.
