<H1>Parcl: An implementation of the Common Lisp package system</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

  This library provides an implementation of the Common Lisp package
  system.

</p>

<p>

  Each each accessor has an extensive documentation string associated
  with it.  There is also embryonic Texinfo documentation, the purpose
  of which is to document the organization of the code.

</p>


<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>

  Depends on <a href="ecclesia.html">Ecclesia</a>.  It represents
  packages as instances of standard classes and it defines many
  generic functions,, so CLOS is required.

</p>


<H2>Maintainers</H2>

<p>

  Currently maintained by Robert Strandh.

</p>

<H2>Possible improvements</H2>

<p>

  Some errors signaled are currently not correctable.  Converting
  those errors to correctable errors is a possible improvement.

</p>
<p>

  Add more Texinfo documentation.
