<H1>Clostrum: First-class global environments</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

This library provides an implementation of first-class global
environments.  It provides an improvement of the protocol documented
in <a href="http://metamodular.com/SICL/environments.pdf">this
paper</a>.

</p>


<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>

  Depends on <a href="trucler.html">Trucler</a> Uses standard classes
  and generic functions, so CLOS is required.

</p>

<H2>Maintainers</H2>

<p>

  Currently maintained by Alex Wood

</p>

<H2>Possible improvements</H2>

<p>

  Some old LaTeX-based documentation is still present in the
  repository and should be eliminated.  Documentation strings need to
  be processed in order to create (say) a PDF document, possibly with
  additional general information about the library.
