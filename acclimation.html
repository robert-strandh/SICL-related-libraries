<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

  This library makes it possible to have different condition
  reporters, and different documentation strings according to the
  choice of a language.  It also contains functions that return the
  names of days and months according to the choice of a language. 

</p>


<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>

  This library does depend on any other library, but it uses standard
  classes and generic functions, so CLOS is required.

</p>

<H2>Maintainers</H2>

<p>

  Currently maintained by Robert Strandh

</p>

<H2>Possible improvements</H2>

<p>

  Currently, less than 10 languors are supported.  One possible
  improvement is to add more languages.
