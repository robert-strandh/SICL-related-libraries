<H1>Salmagundi: Hash tables</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

This library provides an implementation of the classes and functions
in the Hash Tables dictionary of the Common Lisp standard.  It
provides several possible implementations, on of which is a simple
list which is very portable.

</p>

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>
  
  This library does not depend on any other systems, but it uses
  standard classes and generic functions, so CLOS is required.  

</p>

<H2>Maintainers</H2>

<p>

  Currently maintained by Tarn W. Burton.

</p>

<H2>Possible improvements</H2>

<p>

  Documentation strings should be include for all external classes and
  all external functions.  Compiler macros could be added for
  functions with optional or keyword parameters.
