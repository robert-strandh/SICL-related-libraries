<H1>Iconoclast (AST): AST representations of all special forms and all standard macro forms</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

  This library defines standard classes that allow the representation
  of any Common Lisp form as an abstract syntax tree (AST). 

</p>


<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>

  This library does not depend on any other library, but it uses
  standard classes and generic functions, so CLOS is required.

<H2>Possible improvements</H2>

<p>

  AST classses contain information about the <i>cardinality</i> of its
  children, where "1" means a single AST child, "?" means either NIL
  or a single AST child, and "*" means a list of AST children.
  However, there are slots in AST classes that represent cross-links
  in the AST "tree", and there are cases where such links should not
  be traversed.  One possible improvement would be to define a new
  cardinality, say "0", to indicate such links.
