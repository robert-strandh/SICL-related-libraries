<H1>Predicament: An implementation of the Common Lisp condition system</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

  This library provides an implementation of the Common Lisp condition
  system.  It was derived from the code written by Micha≈Ç "phoe" Herda
  as part of his book "The Common Lisp Condition System".  We improved
  it so that it can now be used intrinsically in addition to
  extrinsically.

</p>

<p>

  Each condition type and each accessor has an extensive documentation
  string associated with it.

</p>


<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>

  This library does not depend on any other system, but it represents
  restarts as instances of standard classes and it defines many
  generic functions,, so CLOS is required.

</p>

  Currently maintained by Robert Strandh.
