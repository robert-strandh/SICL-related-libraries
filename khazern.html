<H1>Khazern: An implementation of the <tt>loop</tt> macro</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

This library provides a complete implementation of the
standard <tt>loop</tt> macro.

</p>

<p>

  Contrary to some other implementations of the <tt>loop</tt> macro,
  Khazern makes sure that the loop variable in a clause such
  as <tt>for i from a to b</tt> takes on values only in the closed
  interval between <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>.  Other implementations
  of the <tt>loop</tt> macro will allow the loop variable
  (here <tt>i</tt>) to have the value <tt>b+1</tt>.  With Khazern, it
  is therefore possible to add a reasonable-looking type declaration,
  as in <tt>for i of-type (integer a b) from a to b</tt> that will not
  be violated at run time.

</p>

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>

Depends on <a href="acclimation.html">Acclimation</a>.  This library
uses instances of standard classes to represent <tt>loop</tt> clauses,
so CLOS is required.

  Currently maintained by Tarn W. Burton.

<H2>Possible improvements</H2>

<p>

Clauses are parsed using a home-grown parsing technique that resembles
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator"> parser
  combinators</a>, but without the full backtracking capabilities.  With
this technique, it is hard to provide relevant errors when parsing
fails.  The use of some other parsing technique could be
investigated.
