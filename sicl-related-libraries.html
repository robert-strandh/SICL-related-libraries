<H1>SICL-related libraries</H1>

<p>

We provide a list of projects that were either created as part of the
SICL project, that were extracted and improved from other projects, or
that are used as an essential part of the SICL project.

</p>

<p>

The projects are located either among the
<a href="https://github.com/s-expressionists"> s-expressionists
  repositories</a> or among the repositories at
<a href="https://github.com/robert-strandh"> Robert Strandh's
  collection of repositories</a>.  The aim is to migrate all libraries
  to the s-expressionists site.

</p>  

<p>

  Definitions:

  <ul>

    <li>

    The term <i>extrinsic</i> means that a library can be loaded into
    an existing Common Lisp implementation, without altering the
    existing system code of that implementation, and it can be used
    and tested as any other externally provided code.

    </li>

    <li>

    The term <i>intrinsic</i> means that a library can be used as part
    of a new Common Lisp implementation, or it can be used to replace
    the equivalent code in an existing Common Lisp implementation.  In
    the latter case, the reason for replacing existing code could be
    aspects such as performance, maintainability, or documentation. 

    </li>

  </ul>

</p>

<H2>Libraries related to the standard</H2>

<p>

In this section, we provide a list of libraries, each of which
provides an implementation of some part of the Common Lisp standard,
typically a single dictionary.

</p>

</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="khazern.html">Khazern: An implementation of the <tt>loop</tt> macro</a>.

    <ul>

      <li>
        Can be used extrinsically or intrinsically.  
      </li>

      <li>

        Uses instances of standard classes to represent clauses, so
        CLOS is required for this library.

      </li>

      <li>

        Complete, but lacks documentation.

      </li>

      <li>

        Includes an ANSI-test suite, and it passes all tests.

      </li>

      <li>

      <li>

        Uses instances of standard classes to represent the readtable

      </li>

      <li>

        aspects of the library.  Therefore, CLOS is required for this
        library.

      <li>

        Complete, but undocumented.

      </li>

      <li>

<H2>Other libraries</H2>

<p>

In this section, we provide a list of libraries that provide support
for the creation of Common Lisp implementations, but that do not
provide code that is directly related to the Common Lisp standard.
