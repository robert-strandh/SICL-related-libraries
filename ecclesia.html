<H1>Ecclesia: Code utilities</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

  This library contains utilities for manipulating code in the form of
  S-expressions.  In particular, in contains definitions
  of <tt>parse-macro</tt>, <tt>parse-compiler-macro</tt>, <tt>parse-deftype</tt>
  and <tt>parse-destructuring-bind</tt>.  It also contains code for
  parsing different types of lambda lists.

</p>


<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>

  Depends on <a href="acclimation.html">Acclimation</a>.

<H2>Possible improvements</H2>

<p>

  There are currently two versions of most functions for parsing
  lambda lists, and by extension, also of <tt>parse-macro</tt>, etc.
  The obsolete version uses instances of a standard class to represent
  lambda lists, but then the order of appearance of the lambda-list
  keywords is not preserved.  A more recent version uses
  canonicalization that preserves this order.  Unfortunately, there
  are clients using the obsolete version.
