<H1>Regalia: An implementation of Common Lisp arrays</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

  This library provides implementations for classes and functions in
  the Arrays dictionary of the Common Lisp standard.  For intrinsic
  use, client code must supply accessors for the elements of each
  specialized array type.
  

</p>

<p>

  This library is nearly complete.

</p>


<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>

  This library does not depend on any other system, but it represents
  arrays as instances of standard classes with generic accessors, so
  CLOS is required.

</p>


<H2>Maintainers</H2>

<p>

  Currently maintained by Robert Strandh.

</p>

<H2>Possible improvements</H2>

<p>

  Provide documentation strings for remaining functions.  Add a test
  suite, probably from the ANSI-test suite.
