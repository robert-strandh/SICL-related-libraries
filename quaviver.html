<H1>Quaviver: Fast and accurate floating-point input/output</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>

  This library implementes several algorithms for fast and accurate
  floating-point input output.  Accurate output means that the decimal
  representation is the shortest one that will produce the same
  floating-point number when read.  Accurate input means that the
  floating-point number produced is the closest one to the decimal
  representation of the input.

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<p>


  Depends
  on <a href="https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/alexandria/alexandria">alexandria</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/trivial-features">trivial features</a>.

</p>

<p>

  Uses standard classes and generic functions for various
  aspects of the library.  Therefore, CLOS is required for this
  library.
